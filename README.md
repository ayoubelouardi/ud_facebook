## description
This project aims to upload and download images to/from a Facebook platform.  Due to API limitations, direct image handling isn't feasible for all platforms.  The project will focus on utilizing available APIs to achieve image management functionalities where possible.

## how to ?
this is some possible ways to achieve the descripiton : 


- Facebook Graph API (Limited Functionality):
While direct image upload/download isn't supported, the Graph API might allow you to access information about images (like URLs or IDs) if they're publicly available within posts or albums. You could then use this information to download images indirectly using the requests library. This only works for public content.


- Third-Party APIs (If Available):
Explore if any third-party APIs (not officially affiliated with Facebook) provide image access functionalities. These APIs might offer a less direct, but potentially more stable, way to interact with Facebook image data. However, use extreme caution; verify the legitimacy and security of any third-party API before using it, as they may violate Facebook's terms of service or compromise your data.

- Browser Automation (Selenium/Playwright):
Use a browser automation library like Selenium or Playwright to simulate user actions. This would involve logging into Facebook, navigating to the desired album or post, and using the browser's functionality to download images. For uploading, it would involve simulating the file upload process through the browser's interface. This is highly unreliable due to Facebook's frequent UI updates and potential detection of automated activity.
